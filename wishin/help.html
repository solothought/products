                        <p class="lead">A <strong>Wish</strong> is a personal mission — something that makes you <em>feel alive</em>, <em>curious</em>, or <em>bold</em>. It's not about fixing yourself. It's about <strong>becoming more of who you want to be.</strong></p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            "Your wish is not what you want to escape — it's what you want to <em>create</em>."
                        </blockquote>
                        
                        <p>Unlike goals, wishes are emotional, open-ended, and flexible. They grow as you grow.</p>

                            <strong>🧠 Psychology:</strong> Your brain stores emotions as sensory patterns. When you see an image linked with that pattern, it reactivates the same feeling — bringing back the energy to act.

                        <h3>1. Reward Prediction</h3>
                        <p>When your brain sees a "recorded win," it releases dopamine — not for the result, but for the <em>recognition of effort</em>. That small pleasure becomes your new motivation loop.</p>
                        
                        <h3>2. Shifting Identity</h3>
                        <p>Each win is a micro-proof of who you're becoming. Over time, these notes quietly rewire your self-image from "I'm trying" to "I'm the kind of person who does this."</p>
                        
                        <h3>3. Resilience Memory</h3>
                        <p>When you feel stuck, scrolling through your old wins reminds you that you've been here before — and you've <em>moved forward every time</em>.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>

                        <h2>Connection to Your Why</h2>
                        <p>Your "Wins" are moments when your <strong>Why</strong> takes shape in the real world. They show you which wishes truly matter — the ones that keep pulling you forward even on tough days.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>

                        <p>Think of 2–3 experiences that made you <em>feel alive</em>, <em>grateful</em>, or <em>changed</em>. These could be moments when you:</p>

                            <li>Helped someone and felt proud</li>

                        <p>In every strong memory, there's a hidden value — maybe courage, love, creativity, or honesty. Your Why usually points toward that core value.</p>

                            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Insight:</strong> "I love helping others feel confident."</p>
